# DR_rF2_Plugin
rFactor2 Reader Plugin for [DataRace](https://github.com/LukasLichten/DataRace)  

## Installation
**Don't**, Plugin is still deep wip.  
But anyway, place the binary into the Plugins folder.

Only Linux supported, Windows support will come... eventually...  

## Building
`make` assumes there is a `../DataRace` folder containing the project.  
`make run` only works if you compiled the project before
